      <h4>Turtle's Song</h4>
      <h5>Illustrated by Kim Toft, Story by Alan Brown</h5>
      <p>      

	I am a Turtle. 
	My eyes are black, my shell is green. 
	Wide ocean calls me, as I lie curled in the dark. 
	Tides roar in my blood, surf pounds in my heart. A lyrical journey of the life of a Green Turtle from hatchling beneath the sand of a coral beach, through wanderings at sea, to adulthood and returning to lay eggs of it's own. Award winning illustrator Kim Toft's magnificent silk painting perfectly capture the precarious life of the Green Turtle, while author Alan Brown's poignant, mythical story sounds a hymn to this ancient but now endangered creature.

      <h4>A Fish Out of Water</h4>
      <h5>by Helen Palmer</h5>
      <p>      

In this beloved Beginner Book written by Mrs. Dr. Seuss (aka Helen Palmer), a young boy hilariously learns the consequences of not following instructions when he feeds too much to his goldfish—causing it to grow as big as a whale! With delightfully retro illustrations by P.D. Eastman (Go, Dog. Go!), 
the message of the book—that getting a pet is a big responsibility—is as true today as it was when the book was published in 1961. Perfect for beginning readers and read-alouds—and anyone getting a pet, especially a fish—it's ideal for birthdays, holidays, and happy occasions of all kinds!
<br><br>
Launched in 1957 with The Cat in the Hat and written specifically for emergent readers, Beginner Books combine an exacting blend of simple words and fun pictures that encourage children to read—all by themselves.

      <h4>1984</h4>
      <h5>by George Orwell</h5>
      <p>

The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. 1984 is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia" -a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions -a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.

Kids will love this noise-filled Bright and Early Book classic from the one and only Dr. Seuss! Mr. Brown is a sound-making wonder! He can hoo hoo like an owl and buzz buzz like a bee. It is so much fun to make noises that you hear every day, like moo and tick-tock. But stranger sounds are fun to make, too . . . like the pip of a goldfish kiss and the grum grum of a hippo chewing gum. Encouraging imaginative play while learning to read, Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? will keep kids laughing (when they’re not tick-tocking).
